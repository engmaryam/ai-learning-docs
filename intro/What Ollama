ðŸ§  What is Ollama?
Ollama is an open-source tool that allows you to run large language models (LLMs) locally on your own computerâ€”without needing cloud access.

It supports popular models like LLaMA 2, Mistral, Gemma, and Code LLaMA, and is designed for developers, researchers, and privacy-focused users who want to work with AI offline.

ðŸ”§ Key Features
Local Execution: Run models on your own device (Mac, Windows, or Linux) for full control.

Offline & Private: Your data stays on your machineâ€”nothing is sent to the cloud.

Simple CLI: Easy to use with terminal commands like ollama run llama2.

Model Library: Download and manage many pre-trained models.

API Support: Offers a REST API for integration with apps or other tools (default port: 11434).

Fast & Lightweight: Uses quantization techniques to make large models efficient on standard hardware.

Custom Model Support: Use your own models or fine-tune existing ones with configuration files.
