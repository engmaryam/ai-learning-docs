🧠 What Is a Tokenizer?
A tokenizer is a tool used by language models like GPT to break down text into smaller units (tokens) that the model can understand and process.

These tokens are not always whole words — they can be:

Words

Parts of words (prefixes, suffixes)

Punctuation

Spaces

Even special characters

🧩 What Is a Token?
A token is a piece of text the model reads at one time.

📌 Examples:
Text	Tokens
ChatGPT	1 token
OpenAI is awesome!	4 tokens → ["Open", "AI", " is", " awesome", "!"]
unbelievable	3 tokens → ["un", "believ", "able"]
The quick brown fox	5 tokens → ["The", " quick", " brown", " fox"]

Even spaces are part of tokens, so "Hello" and " Hello" are different.

⚖️ Why Tokens Matter
Token Limit

GPT-4-turbo has a 128,000 token limit per request (combined input + output).

GPT-3.5-turbo supports up to 16,385 tokens.

Pricing

You are billed per token, both for the input you send and the output you receive.

Example: If you send 500 tokens and get 1,000 back, you're billed for 1,500 tokens.

Model Memory

The token limit also controls how much the model can "remember" or keep track of in a conversation.

Exceeding the limit will cause older parts of the conversation or text to be dropped.

🛠 Tools to Use
✅ OpenAI Tokenizer Playground
Try it here: https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer

Paste text and see how it's split into tokens.

✅ Python Package (tiktoken)
If you're coding, OpenAI provides a tokenizer library called tiktoken.

python
Copy
Edit
import tiktoken

enc = tiktoken.encoding_for_model("gpt-4")
tokens = enc.encode("Hello, world!")
print(tokens)          # → [9906, 11, 995]
print(len(tokens))     # → 3 tokens
🧮 Real-world Example
Input:
"Hi! My name is Maryam. I run Cognexa LLC."

Token Breakdown:
"Hi" → 1 token

"!" → 1 token

" My" → 1 token

" name" → 1 token

" is" → 1 token

" Maryam" → 1 token

"." → 1 token

" I run" → 2 tokens

" Cognexa" → 1 token

" LLC" → 1 token

"." → 1 token

✅ Total tokens = ~11–12 tokens (approx.)

✅ Summary
Feature	Description
Token	A small chunk of text (can be part of a word)
Why It's Used	GPT reads and thinks in tokens, not whole words
Cost	You’re charged per token
Limit	Each model has a max number of tokens it can handle
