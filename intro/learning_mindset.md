AI Concepts & Key Terms 
🤖 Artificial Intelligence (AI)

AI refers to machines or software that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence — such as reasoning, learning, planning, and problem-solving.

🔬 Machine Learning (ML)

A subset of AI where machines learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed. It includes both supervised and unsupervised learning.

🧐 Deep Learning

A specialized branch of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks ("deep" networks) to learn from complex data like images, language, and audio.

🤠 Transformer

A deep learning model architecture based on self-attention mechanisms. Introduced in 2017 by Google, it powers modern AI systems like GPT and BERT. It enables efficient parallel processing and superior understanding of long-range relationships in data.

🌐 Large Language Model (LLM)

A type of AI model based on the Transformer architecture, trained on massive amounts of text data. LLMs generate human-like language and can perform tasks like answering questions, summarizing, translating, and writing code.

Examples: GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA, Gemini

📈 Generative AI (GenAI)

A broader category of AI systems that can create new content such as text, images, code, audio, and video.

LLMs are a subcategory of GenAI focused on generating text.

Other types of GenAI:

Image GenAI: DALL·E, Midjourney

Audio GenAI: ElevenLabs, MusicGen

Video GenAI: RunwayML, Pika

💡 Relationship Summary:

Deep Learning is the technique

Transformer is a model architecture built with deep learning

LLMs are built using Transformers to understand/generate language

GenAI includes LLMs and other generators (image, code, audio)
