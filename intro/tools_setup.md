🛠️ Tools Setup for AI Engineering

Before diving into coding and machine learning, it's essential to get your environment ready. These are the tools you'll need to learn, build, and test AI projects efficiently. Everything here is free or open-source.

✅ Core Tools You Need

1. Python

Language used in most AI and ML projects

Version: Use Python 3.10+

Download: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. VS Code (or another IDE)

Lightweight, powerful code editor

Extensions: Python, Jupyter, GitHub Copilot (optional)

Download: https://code.visualstudio.com/

3. Git + GitHub

Track your projects and push to the cloud

Create a GitHub account if you don’t have one

Git install: https://git-scm.com/

GitHub: https://github.com/

4. Anaconda (optional but helpful)

Package + environment manager with pre-installed data science libraries

Download: https://www.anaconda.com/

5. Jupyter Notebooks

Great for learning, running experiments, and documenting code

Comes with Anaconda, or install via pip:

pip install notebook

Run it with:

jupyter notebook

📦 Python Libraries to Install

These are the libraries you’ll use throughout your journey:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
pip install tensorflow keras torch torchvision

You can add others like:

pip install opencv-python openai langchain

🌐 Optional but Helpful

Postman – test APIs easily

Docker – containerize your models

Notion / Obsidian – take notes as you learn

Kaggle – access datasets and compete in ML challenges

🚀 Once Everything is Installed

Try this in your terminal or Jupyter:

import numpy as np
print("Environment setup complete!")

If you see output, you’re ready to start learning.

💬 Tip: Set up a learning-environment/ folder where you try each tool and test commands as you install them.

Next: Let’s start learning Python basics and data structures.
